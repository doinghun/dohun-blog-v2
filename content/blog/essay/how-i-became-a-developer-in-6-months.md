So finally, there comes a day I‚Äôm writing my version of HIBAD (How I Became a Developer). There are so many versions of ‚ÄúHow I Became a Developer in X months‚Äù and I yearned so much for my time to write my version of it üòé

## Why I Decided to Become a Software Developer

Perhaps it will be more interesting to start off with some personal touch of why I decided to become a software developer.

Prior to my decision to become a developer, I did Growth Marketing in a tech company for 1.5 years. And when I was about to dive deeper into Marketing or more specifically <a href="https://brianbalfour.com/essays/growth-vs-marketing-vs-product" target="_blank">Growth</a>, I was fortunately (in the hindsight) in the crossroad to leave with compensation package or to stay in the company. That was the moment when a thought flashed off my mind and I decided ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be a Software Developer‚Äù.

Well of course, it didn‚Äôt just pop up on my mind without prior build up. It goes back to the time when I launched a side-project in my uni years. My friends and I launched a side-project to build platform for self-storage in the university dorms (Image Airbnb for Self-Storage of personal goods). Our idea was validated winning Startup Competitions and Innovation Grant from the university innovation centre. We had big ideas and execution plans except the most important part - Developer to build the product. However, we convinced ourselves we could build a MVP without a software developer as we couldn‚Äôt find a developer in sync with our idea and vision. Eventually we didn‚Äôt move fast and were faced with obstacles we couldn‚Äôt get past, end of that story. (Maybe I‚Äôll write more about the side-project story in the future.) There were many lessons learnt from this experience but the biggest one for me was this - you need Software Developer to build a d*mn product.

However, I thought it was too late to drop everything to study programming. Most importantly, I thought I wasn‚Äôt smart enough to become one. I was so used to taking easy way out in life and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to believe that I can, indeed become a developer. I knew Internet and tech industry was where I belonged and I decided to start my career at a Travel Tech company doing marketing.

Fast forward to when I left my previous company to become a developer, it took me exactly 5 months from Sept 2019 to Jan 2020 for me to get the offer from a reputable tech company to work as a FrontEnd Software Engineer.

## How I Became A Developer in 5 months

*Note that my definition of a developer here is when one officially gets hired as a Software Devolper. I do believe everyone is a developer when one can build software products of any functionality.*

I embarked on the road to become a developer with a self-study plan. Yes, I did not attend any bootcamps (Here‚Äôs my answer to that)

My Self-Study plan broadly consisted of these 3 phases

- Phase 1: Take Udemy Courses & Solve Leetcode Easy level questions
- Phase 2: Build personalised portfolio with 3, 4 projects & Solve Leetcode Easy, Medium level questions
- Phase 3: Solve Leetcode, Interview Questions and Job Application.

### Phase 1: Take Udmey Courses & Start Leetcode (2 months)

Like all other beginner level programmers, I had no idea if I wanted to do back-end, front-end or full-stack development. Therefore, taking Udemy courses on JavaScript, NodeJs and React gave me exposure to all types of stacks and I eventually decided to go with Front-End as I had a great admiration for aesthetically pleasing software products.

Here are the lessons I took on Udemy over a period of 2 - 3 months:

- [PluralSight - JavaScript Intro](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-getting-started)
- [Udemy - NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/)
- [Udemy - React](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/)

I also started solving leetcode questions with easy level sorted by Acceptance level descending. Most questions on the top are Array and Strings questions with use of forloops and thus, I could do them without studying Data Structures in details. However, I got really insecure about not knowing about Data Structures much so I tried to get a basic sense of what are different types of Data Structures without going into details.

### Phase 2: Build personalised Portfolio with 3 projects and Leetcode On (2 months)

What I like about Udemy courses are, you get to build a small and simple projects following the instructors. As soon as I got quite confident that I knew how to build things using the tech stack, I started building my simple projects with a little bit of personal touch. For example, I built the same To-Do List firstly with NodeJS and then React. Both were includede in my portfolio. Additionally, I explored other types of tasks you can do with JavaScript and built simple programmes like Instagram Like bot and Facebook Messenger Chatbot for Travellers. I focused on getting these projects out there. (eg. launching on Heroku and uploading public on Github) Even though I had no followers on Github, the recruiters could see them.

By the phase 2, I solved probably about 50 leetcode questions (Easy & high acceptance rate). From then, I figured some kind of patterns in the questions that could be solved by certain algorithms and I got exposure to more complicated Data Structures like Sinlgly Linked List, Doubly Linked List and Binary Tree. (I still didn‚Äôt know them in details) I started timing myself per question and searched on the web for the <a href="https://github.com/doinghun/leetcode/tree/master/%5BBlind%20Curated%20Top%20%2075%5D" target="_blank">curated list of questions that MUST BE ATTEMPTED</a> before a software engineer interview. And LEETCODE-ed ON.

### Phase 3: Apply for Job, Study Interview Questions and Leetcode On (2 months++)

4 months in, I wasn‚Äôt ready for job application but yet I was. I wasn‚Äôt confident if I had the sufficient skillset to start working as a Developer in a company but I started crafting resume with a focus on my software projects. I started applying as soon as I felt that the resume had the bare minimum. This period fell in December for me and being it the holiday season, I had barely any replies (1 in 10). 5 months in and from January, I started submitting 2 applications per day and soon, I started to get phone interview emails and calls meaning my resume got past the screening..! Then it was time to study Interview Questions.

I specifically prepared for Front End Interviews and most companies followed below format:

1. Phone Interview with Recruiter going through Resume
2. Online Coding Test (Leetcode type questions - mostly easy, occasionally medium level)
3. Online/Offline Technical Interview with Engineers (JavaScript, CSS concepts + React)

I had to continuously refresh JavaScript , CSS and React fundamental concepts and following resources were very useful to me:

- [30 seconds of Interview](https://30secondsofinterviews.org/)
- [Tech Interview Handbook](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/introduction)
- [10 Interview Questions Every JavaScript Developer Should Know](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95)

And by end of January 2020, I was lucky to have a favourable offer at a reputable tech company as Front End Software Engineer and I‚Äôm excited to start off my career as a Software Developer :)
